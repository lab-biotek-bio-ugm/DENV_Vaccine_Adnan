MHC-I Processing:
IEDB -> MHC-I Processing -> Proteasomal cleavage/TAP transport/MHC class I combined predictor

Enter 5 epitopes with top combinatorial score from NetCTL -> set prediction method to SMM (Stabilized Matrix Method) -> MHC source species human -> untick "show only frequently occuring alleles" 
-> choose all availabale alleles, set all length to 9.0 -> choose the desired output format -> submit

Population Coverage:
IEDB -> population coverage -> set number of epitopes to 1 -> enter the desired epitope ->
choose MHC-I and MHC-II combined -> choose all available alleles from datasets, ignore the identical ones 
-> submit
